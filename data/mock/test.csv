Embarrassing moment of the week.,33
Need soup and sleep immediately.,37
Wearing a mask and staying in.,35
Everything is spinning. Need to lie down.,36
Can't keep my eyes open.,23
Can’t believe how angry I still am.,21
Why follow rules when I can bend them?,28
Feeling a little mischievous today.,28
Regretting that sketchy lunch.,38
Food poisoning is no joke.,38
Just pretend that didn’t happen.,33
Wearing a mask and staying in.,35
Eyes on me everywhere I go.,29

Sick of repeating myself.,27
Time to stir some trouble.,28

Trying to stay pure and kind.,24
